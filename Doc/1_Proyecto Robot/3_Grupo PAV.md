### Weight and Dimensions Robot

The main components of the robot will have a total weight of 307 g, plus an additional 100 g for fasteners. Therefore, the structure must not exceed 593 g. The robot's dimensions will be 144 mm in width, 112.8 mm in length, and 30 mm in height.

### Robot Weapon

The Micro Metal 50:1 HP Motor, measuring 26 × 10 × 12 mm and weighing 10 g, will drive a drum with a protrusion to latch onto the enemy robot, allowing it to flip it over. With a maximum torque of 1.1 kg·cm, a speed of 625 RPM, it will have an impact force of over 1 kg.

### Shovel Weapo

The robot features a shovel weapon designed to sweep along the ground and remove enemy robots from its path. The shovel can rotate up to 180 degrees, providing a wide range of motion to push opponents aside. It is powered by a S3003 continuous rotation servo (360°), known for its high torque and reliability, making it ideal for small combat robots. This setup allows the shovel to apply consistent force while maintaining precise control during the fight

### Robot Traction

The N20 motor (133 RPM) delivers a torque of up to 1 kg·cm and a speed of 133 RPM at 12V, making it ideal for robot traction. It features a compact size and weighs only 10 g. The robot will use two of these motors. Steering is achieved through di􀄔erential steering, where the wheels on each side are driven at di􀄔erent torques, allowing the robot to turn by varying the relative motion between the two sides.

### Robot Control

The robot uses an ESP32 Wroom with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, o􀄔ering flexible and reliable connection. A mobile app controls steering and activates weapons in real time.
